# Dex Aggregator

**Overview**

The Onchain Toolkit DEX Aggregator is powered by Rubic, a sophisticated platform enabling users to seamlessly swap tokens across three major blockchain networks: Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain (BSC), and Polygon. This aggregator streamlines the process of exchanging tokens by pooling liquidity from various decentralized exchanges (DEXes) to ensure users receive the best possible trade value.

**How The DEX Aggregator Works**

1. **Multi-Chain Integration**: Users can swap tokens on Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, and Polygon without needing to switch between different DEX interfaces.
2. **Aggregation Mechanism**: Onchain Toolkit aggregates liquidity from multiple DEXes on each chain. When a user initiates a swap, Rubic scans its network of DEXes to find the most favorable exchange rate.
3. **Automated Swap Process**: Users simply choose the tokens they want to swap and the quantity. The aggregator handles the rest, including selecting the best trade route.

**Automated Slippage**

* **Automated Adjustment**: Rubic automatically sets slippage tolerance, typically up to 49%, to ensure the trade goes through even with minor price movements.
* **Advantage**: This feature removes the guesswork for users, streamlining the swapping process.

**BEWARE: High Tax Tokens**

* **Automated Slippage Caution**: While the automated slippage feature is convenient, it may not be suitable for tokens with high taxes or fees. Tokens with built-in transaction fees might require manual slippage adjustments to ensure a successful swap.
* **User Responsibility**: Users are advised to be aware of the tokenomics of the assets they are trading, especially those with higher than usual transaction fees.
