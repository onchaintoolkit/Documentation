The swap process will take a few minutes as LayerZero technology securely transfers your assets across networks.

You can monitor the progress of your transaction directly on the platform or by checking the transaction ID in a blockchain explorer.

**Step 7: Verify Your Balance**

Once the swap is complete, your assets will appear in your wallet on the destination blockchain.

Open your wallet and ensure the token balance reflects the swapped amount.

**Best Practices for Crosschain Swaps**

Check Supported Assets: Ensure the asset and blockchain combination is supported by Onchain Toolkit.

Verify Fees: Review transaction fees before confirming the swap to avoid surprises.

Ensure Sufficient Gas: Make sure you have enough native cryptocurrency (e.g., ETH, BNB) for gas fees on both the source and destination networks.

Use a Reliable Wallet: Ensure your wallet is up to date and compatible with LayerZero-powered swaps.
