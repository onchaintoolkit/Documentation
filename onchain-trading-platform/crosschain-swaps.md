# Crosschain Swaps

Once connected, you can select the input token (shown by the arrow at top side) and the output token (shown by the arrow bottom side). The input is the token you want to swap from. For example, if you want to buy USDT using your Ethereum, select Ethereum as the input and USDT as the output.

If the token is not listed in the dropdown menu, you can also paste the token contract address into the search input bar to find the token you want. This functionality is available for both the input and output fields.

Itâ€™s much easier and more convenient for users to swap directly on the token's terminal page. By searching for any token in the terminal and clicking the swap button, users can initiate a swap instantly without needing to copy and paste the address into a separate global swap page. This streamlined process saves time and enhances the user experience by keeping everything within one interface.

Once you have clicked "Calculate," the platform will present the best value options for your trade. Review these options and select the aggregator that offers the most favorable terms. Click "Trade" on your chosen aggregator, and your wallet will prompt you to confirm the transaction. If you haven't granted an allowance for the token yet, you may need to approve the token before proceeding with the transaction.
