Once tokens are added to the Watchlist, users can view a range of important real-time metrics:

* **Token Price**: Stay updated with the latest price of each token in the Watchlist.

* **Trading Volume**: Monitor the tokenâ€™s trading volume to gauge market activity.
* **Liquidity Pool Value**: Access information on the total value locked in the liquidity pools associated with each token, which is crucial for understanding market depth and potential slippage.

These metrics are presented in an organized manner, enabling users to make well-informed trading decisions quickly.

To further enhance usability, the Watchlist includes sorting and filtering functionalities. Users can sort tokens by price, percentage changes, or liquidity pool value, allowing them to prioritize the information most relevant to their trading strategy. By clicking on the sorting arrows, users can reorder their list according to these metrics, making it easier to spot opportunities or manage risks.

**5. Seamless Navigation and User Experience**\
Navigating through the Watchlist is made simple with the ability to quickly scroll through pages, jump to specific pages, and search for tokens within the Watchlist. The interface is designed to be responsive, ensuring that all relevant data is accessible on various devices, including desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.
