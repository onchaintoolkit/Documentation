# ðŸŸ¢ DEX Aggregator Swap

The **DEX Aggregator Swap** feature allows users to efficiently swap tokens across multiple decentralized exchanges (DEXs) in a single transaction. This powerful tool aggregates liquidity from various sources to ensure users get the best possible rates and minimal slippage during their trades.

**Best Price Discovery:** The aggregator searches across multiple DEXs to find the most favorable exchange rate for the token pair you want to swap. This ensures that users are always getting the best deal available at the time of the transaction.

**Multi-DEX Integration:** By connecting to several DEXs, the aggregator maximizes liquidity, reducing the likelihood of slippage and improving the execution of large trades.

To utilize the swap feature, begin by connecting your wallet and selecting the appropriate network for your transaction. Once your wallet is connected, the "Connect Wallet" button will change to a "Calculate" button, allowing you to proceed with your swap.

Once connected, you can select the input token (shown by the arrow at top side) and the output token (shown by the arrow bottom side). The input is the token you want to swap from. For example, if you want to buy USDT using your Ethereum, select Ethereum as the input and USDT as the output.

If the token is not listed in the dropdown menu, you can also paste the token contract address into the search input bar to find the token you want. This functionality is available for both the input and output fields.

{% hint style="info" %}
Itâ€™s much easier and more convenient for users to swap directly on the token's terminal page. By searching for any token in the terminal and clicking the swap button, users can initiate a swap instantly without needing to copy and paste the address into a separate global swap page. This streamlined process saves time and enhances the user experience by keeping everything within one interface.
{% endhint %}

Once you have clicked "Calculate," the platform will present the best value options for your trade. Review these options and select the aggregator that offers the most favorable terms. Click "Trade" on your chosen aggregator, and your wallet will prompt you to confirm the transaction. If you haven't granted an allowance for the token yet, you may need to approve the token before proceeding with the transaction.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Please note that if your wallet does not have a sufficient balance of the token or native coin required for the swap, clicking "Trade" will not initiate the transaction. To avoid any issues, ensure that your balance is sufficient by reviewing the amount displayed in the input field before proceeding.

#### Locations:

* **Main Swap Interface:** Access the DEX Aggregator Swap through the main trading interface, where you can easily select your tokens and execute trades.
* **Token-Specific Swap:** If you are viewing a specific token on its detailed page, the swap option is directly available, allowing you to initiate trades without leaving the token's analytics page.
