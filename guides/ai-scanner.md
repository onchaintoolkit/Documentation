# ðŸŸ¢ AI Scanner

The AI Scanner provided by GoPlus and Revoluzion is a comprehensive tool designed to help users scan and analyze token addresses, normal wallet addresses, smart contracts, and allowances in user wallets. Below is a detailed guide on how to utilize each tab within the AI Scanner.

* Note that if the contract address provided is not a token smart contract address, an error message will appear, indicating that the address needs to be a valid token smart contract.
* Also note that, if the total of the address is 42 and below, clicking scan will not result anything.

**Select Network:**



* Select the appropriate network where the contract is deployed.



**Input Contract Address:**

**Scan for Vulnerabilities:**

**Allowance Tab**

The Allowance tab allows users to check and manage token allowances for their wallet addresses.

**Connect Wallet:**



* Before using this tab, click the "Connect Wallet" button to connect your wallet to the scanner.

* Click "Scan" to view all token allowances granted by your wallet. The scanner will display a list of allowances, showing the tokens, their corresponding smart contracts, and the amount allowed.
*   In the event the scan button do not appear, it means that you have yet to connect your wallet. Click on the connect wallet button to connect your wallet first.

* Even after connecting your wallet, you can still scan for allowances associated with any other wallet address. However, please note that you won't have the ability to revoke those allowances for addresses other than your own.



* **Revoke Allowances:**
  *   If you wish to revoke any allowance, simply click the "Revoke" button next to the corresponding allowance. This will remove the permission granted to the smart contract, preventing it from accessing your tokens.

  *   When you click the "Revoke Allowance" button, a confirmation prompt will appear in your connected wallet (e.g., MetaMask). You will then need to approve the transaction, which will reset the allowance to zero.

  *   In the event there is no revoke allowance button is shown and change network button instead as shown below, kindly click on change network to the appropriate network and the revoke button will be shown.
